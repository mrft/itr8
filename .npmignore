# Since we want to allow users to do things like:
#   import { * } from itr8/operators/...
# (instead of import { * } from itr8/dist/operators/...)
# we are NOT specifying the package.json/files files property (or setting it to *, that's the same)
# but some files can be removed when the package is installed as a dependency.
# So we are turning this around:
#   keep everything, but remove what is listed in ths .npmignore
# for example: we'll remove the src and test and docs folders (and others)
#   cfr. https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json?v=true#files
